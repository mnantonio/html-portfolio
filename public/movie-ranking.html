<h1>The Best Movies According to Marco</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>
  When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a medical procedure to
  have each other erased from their memories for ever. Great Sci-Fi Rom-Com, the
  chemistry between Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey is very observable.
</p>

<h3>Joe Vs. The Volcano</h3>
<p>
  When a hypochondriac learns that he is dying, he accepts an offer to throw
  himself in a volcano at a tropical island, and along the way there, learns to
  truly live. It has a lot of symbolism and deeper meaning into it. Meg Ryan
  plays three different characters in this movie.
</p>

<h3>Toy Story</h3>
<p>
  A cowboy doll is profoundly threatened and jealous when a new spaceman action
  figure supplants him as top toy in a boy's bedroom. The first computer
  animated movie released. Wonderful story for the whole family.
